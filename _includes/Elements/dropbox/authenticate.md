# Authenticate with {{page.heading}}

You can authenticate with {{page.heading}} to create your own instance of the {{page.heading}} element through the UI or through APIs. Once authenticated, you can use the element instance to access the different functionality offered by the {{page.heading}} platform.

## Authenticate Through the UI

Use the UI to authenticate with {{page.heading}} and create an element instance. {{page.heading}} authentication follows the typical OAuth 2 framework and you will need to sign in to {{page.heading}} as part of the process.

If you are configuring events, see the [Events section](events.html).

To authenticate an element instance:

1. Sign in to Cloud Elements, and then search for {{page.heading}} in our Elements Catalog.

    | Cloud Elements 2.0 | Earlier UI  |
    | :------------- | :------------- |
    |  ![Search](../img/Element-Search2.png)  |  ![Search](../img/Element-Search.png)  |

3. Create an element instance.

    | Cloud Elements 2.0 | Earlier UI  |
    | :------------- | :------------- |
    | Hover over the element card, and then click __Create Instance__.</br> ![Create Instance](../img/Create-Instance.gif)  | Click __Add Instance__.</br> ![Search](../img/Add-Instance.png)  |

5. Enter a name for the element instance.
6. For Dropbox Business, enter your **App key** and **App secret** in **API Key** and **API Secret**.
6. With **Document Hub Tagging** select whether you want to enable document tagging.
9. In Cloud Elements 2.0, optionally type or select one or more tags to add to the authenticated element instance.
7. Click __Create Instance__ (latest UI) or __Next__ (earlier UI).
8. Provide your {{page.heading}} credentials, and then allow the connection.

    After you authenticate with the API Provider, the authentication flow returns you to {{site.console}}.

8. If using the earlier UI, optionally add tags to the authenticated element instance.
9. Note the **Token** and **ID** and save them for all future requests using the element instance.

8. Take a look at the documentation for the element resources now available to you.

## Authenticate Through API

Authenticating through API is a multi-step process that involves:

* [Getting a redirect URL](#getting-a-redirect-url). This URL sends users to the vendor to log in to their account.
* [Authenticating users and receiving the authorization grant code](#authenticating-users-and-receiving-the-authorization-grant-code). After the user logs in, the vendor makes a callback to the specified url with an authorization grant code.
* [Authenticating the element instance](#authenticating-the-element-instance). Using the authorization code from the vendor, authenticate with the vendor to create an element instance at Cloud Elements.

### Getting a Redirect URL

Use the following API call to request a redirect URL where the user can authenticate with the vendor. Replace `{keyOrId}` with the element key, `{{page.elementKey}}`.

```bash
GET /elements/{keyOrId}/oauth/url?apiKey=<api_key>&apiSecret=<api_secret>&callbackUrl=<url>&siteAddress=<url>
```

#### Query Parameters

| Query Parameter | Description   |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| apiKey | The key obtained from registering your app with the provider. This is the **App key** that you noted at the end of the [API Provider Setup section](setup.html).  |
| apiSecret |  The client secret obtained from registering your app with the provider.  This is the **App secret** that you noted at the end of the [API Provider Setup section](setup.html).   |
| callbackUrl | The URL that will receive the code from the vendor to be used to create an element instance. This is the **Redirect URI** that you noted at the end of the [API Provider Setup section](setup.html).  |

#### Example cURL

```bash
curl -X GET
-H 'Content-Type: application/json'
'https://api.cloud-elements.com/elements/api-v2/elements/{{page.elementKey}}/oauth/url?apiKey=fake_api_key&apiSecret=fake_api_secret&callbackUrl=https://www.mycoolapp.com/auth&state={{page.elementKey}}'
```

#### Example Response

Use the `oauthUrl` in the response to allow users to authenticate with the vendor.

```json
{
"element": "{{page.elementKey}}",
"oauthUrl": "https://www.dropboxbusiness.com/api/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=insert_dropbox_client_id0&redirect_uri=https://www.mycoolapp.com/auth&state=dropboxbusiness"
}
```

### Authenticating Users and Receiving the Authorization Grant Code

Provide the response from the previous step to the users. After they authenticate, {{page.heading}} provides the following information in the response:

* code
* state

| Response Parameter | Description   |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| code | The Authorization Grant Code required by Cloud Elements to retrieve the OAuth access and refresh tokens from the endpoint.|
| state | A customizable identifier, typically the element key (`{{page.elementKey}}`) . |

{% include note.html content="If the user denies authentication and/or authorization, there will be a query string parameter called <code>error</code> instead of the <code>code</code> parameter. In this case, your application can handle the error gracefully." %}

### Authenticating the Element Instance

Use the `/instances` endpoint to authenticate with {{page.heading}} and create an element instance. If you are configuring events, see the [Events section](events.html).

{% include note.html content="The endpoint returns an Element id and token upon successful completion. Retain the token and id for all subsequent requests involving this element instance.  " %}

To create an element instance:

1. Construct a JSON body as shown below (see [Parameters](#parameters)):

    ```json
            {
              "element": {
                "key": "{{page.elementKey}}"
              },
              "providerData": {
                "code": "<AUTHORIZATION_GRANT_CODE>"
              },
              "configuration": {
                "oauth.api.key": "<CLIENT_ID>",
                "oauth.api.secret": "<CLIENT_SECRET>",
                "oauth.callback.url": "https://www.mycoolapp.com/auth"
              },
              "tags": [
                "<ADD_YOUR_TAGS>"
              ],
              "name": "<INSTANCE_NAME>"
            }
    ```

1. Call the following, including the JSON body you constructed in the previous step:

        POST /instances

    {% include note.html content="Make sure that you include the User and Organization keys in the header. See <a href=index.html#authenticating-with-cloud-elements>the Overview</a> for details. " %}

9. Note the **Token** and **ID** and save them for all future requests using the element instance.

#### Example cURL

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://api.cloud-elements.com/elements/api-v2/instances \
  -H 'authorization: User <USER_SECRET>, Organization <ORGANIZATION_SECRET>' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "element": {
      "key": "{{page.elementKey}}"
    },
    "providerData": {
      "code": "8aa74ff8ae16ba3ca19d12cbdea83aff16bddcd7"
    },
    "configuration": {
      "oauth.api.key": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "oauth.api.secret": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "oauth.callback.url": "https://mycoolapp.com/auth"
    },
    "tags": [
      "Test"
    ],
    "name": "API Instance"
  }'
```
